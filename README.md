# First ReactJS Web Application

A basic web application created using ReactJS. The web application extracts data of posts from JSONPlaceholder and reflects the data in the form of a table.

## Getting Started

1. Unzip the project folder
2. Change the directory within the terminal to the project folder
3. Run 'npm start'
4. An instance of the program should run in your default browser [Default: localhost:3000]

### Prerequisites

This program requires NodeJS and npm installed into the local system

### Installing [Windows]

1. Install NodeJS and npm from https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
2. Install ReactJS by entering 'npm install -g create-react-app' into the command-line terminal

## Deployment

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
